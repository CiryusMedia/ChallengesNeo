# Ciryus Challenge Plugin Neo

The Ciryus Challenge Plugin is back in a new form with new features, non-mangled code (at least we hope so) and new members that (want to) contribute!

## Using this plugin in your content

Always link to this project if you use it in Youtube longform- and live-content, credit us in the caption if you're using it on Tiktok and maybe pin a message in your Twitch chat if you're using it there, however, we know how ugly crediting on Twitch can be, so the Twitch step is optional.
